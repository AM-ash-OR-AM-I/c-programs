// A baseball playerâ€™s batting average is calculated as the number of hits
// divided by the official number of at-bats. In calculating official at-bats,
// walks, sacrifices, and occasions when hit by the pitch are not counted. Write
// a program that takes an input file containing player numbers and batting
// records. Trips to the plate are coded in the batting record as follows:
// H-hit, O-out, W-walk, S-sacrifice, P-hit by pitch. The program should output
// for each player the input data followed by the batting average. Each batting
// record is followed by a newline character. Your program should not use any
// kind of array and array processing
