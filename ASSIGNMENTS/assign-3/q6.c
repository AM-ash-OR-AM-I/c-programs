// Write a program to process a collection of the speeds of vehicles. Your program should count and
// print the number of vehicles moving at a high speed (90 miles/hour or higher), the number of vehicles
// moving at a medium speed (50-89 miles/hour), and the number of vehicles moving at a slow speed
// (less than 50 miles/hour). It should also display the category of each vehicle. Test your program on
// the following data in a file:
// 43 23 54 57 68 67 51 90 33 22 11 88 34 52 75 12 78 32 89 14 65 67 97
// 53 10 47 34
// a. 
// Also code to display the average speed of a category of vehicle (a real number) at the end of the run.
// b. Store the data into a file vspeed.txt. Use input redirection to read all numbers from that file.
// (i.e. ./a.out < vspeed.txt)
