// Write a program to grade an n-question multiple-choice exam (for n between 5
// and 50) and provide feedback about the most frequently missed questions. Your
// program will take data from the file examdat.txt. The first line of the file
// contains the number of questions on the exam followed by a space and then an
// n -character string of the correct answers. Write a function fgetAnswers that
// inputs the answers from an open input file. Each of the lines that follow
// contain an integer student ID followed by a space and then that student’s
// answers. Function fgetAnswers can also be called to input a student’s
// answers. Your program is to produce an output file, report.txt, containing
// the answer key, each student’s ID and each student’s score as a percentage,
// and then information about how many students missed each question. Here are
// short sample input and output files.
