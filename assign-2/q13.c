/*
Keiths Sheet Music needs a program to implement its music teachers discount
policy. The program is to prompt the user to enter the purchase total and to
indicate whether the purchaser is a teacher. The store plans to give each
customer a printed receipt, so your program is to create a nicely formatted file
called receipt.txt. Music teachers receive a 10% discount on their sheet music
purchases unless the purchase total is $100 or higher. In that case, the
discount is 12%. The discount calculation occurs before addition of the 5% sales
tax. Here are two sample output filesone for a teacher and one for a nonteacher.
Total purchases $122.00
Teacherâ€™s discount (12%) 14.64
Discounted total 107.36
Sales tax (5%) 5.37
Total $112.73
Total purchases $24.90
Sales tax (5%) 1.25
Total $26.15
Note: to display a % sign, place two % signs in the format string:
printf("%d%%", SALES_TAX);

To write the output in the file receipt.txt use output redirection, ./a.out >
receipt.txt
